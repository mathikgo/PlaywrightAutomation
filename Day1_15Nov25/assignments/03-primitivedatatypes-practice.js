/*Learning Objective:
Learn primitive data types in JavaScript
Expected Completion Time:
Best Case: 10 minutes
Average Case: 15 minutes
Assignment Details:
Declare variables using `let` for different data types in JavaScript, and verify their types using `typeof`,
including an uninitialized variable.
Assignment Requirements:
Create the following variables using let (not using var) and check their typeOf
a) firstName
b) companyName
c) mobileNumber
d) isAutomation
e) hasPlaywright (do not assign)
Print and confirm the values and data types
Hints to Solve:
Focus on initializing variables with different values, including a string, number, boolean, and leave one
variable undefined to practice with `typeof`.
Expected Outcome:
Upon completion, you should be able to:
- Grasp the concepts of different data types in JavaScript*/
